I was bored so I wrote a spell checker. I played around with making a realtime spell checker but [someone beat me to it](https://web.archive.org/web/20051001123028/https://me.eae.net/archive/2005/05/27/dhtml-spell-checker/) (read: I couldn't get it working properly).

This spell checker uses the [SCOWL word list](http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/) and the [DoubleMetaphone](http://aspell.net/metaphone/) phonetic algorithm for suggestions.
