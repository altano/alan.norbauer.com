Since I used a DoubleMetaphone function and wordlist that I did not
create, and come with copyrights of their own, I must include those
copyrights with my software.  You are free to modify/redistribute this
software and all its contents as long as you adhere to those copyrights.

    by Lawrence Philips which he published in the June, 2000 issue

    This PHP translation is based heavily on the C implementation
    by Maurice Aubrey <maurice@hevanet.com>, which in turn  
    is based heavily on the C++ implementation by
    Lawrence Philips and incorporates several bug fixes courtesy
    of Kevin Atkinson <kevina@users.sourceforge.net>.

      Bug fix: added code to return class object which I forgot to do
      Created a functional callable version instead of the class version
      which is faster if you are calling this a lot.
