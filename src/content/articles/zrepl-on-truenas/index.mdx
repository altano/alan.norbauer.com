TrueNAS mounts several root directories as temporary filesystems (tmpfs) that are erased on every reboot. This includes the zrepl service script located at `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zrepl`. This guide demonstrates how to setup zrepl in a way that survives reboots and OS updates while preserving `service zrepl XXX` functionality.

## What is zrepl?

[zrepl](https://zrepl.github.io/) is a "one-stop, integrated solution for ZFS replication." There is a replication engine built-into TrueNAS (written by the same folks as TrueNAS) called [zettarepl](https://github.com/truenas/zettarepl) but I've found it to be too buggy to use.

## Prerequisites

- TrueNAS (tested on version 12.0-U7)
  - Web GUI access
  - ssh access (with root/sudo)

## Non-goals

This guide only shows you how to _install_ zrepl on TrueNAS. Consult [my other guide on replacing zettarepl with zrepl for more information on using it](/articles/truenas-replace-zettarepl-with-zrepl)

## Setup

### Install the Package

Figure out what version of `zrepl` you're going to need. The `zrepl` version must match on both the source and sink side of the replication. Once you know (e.g. `v0.5.0`) then you have to find the FreeBSD release branch that has that version. Your options are FreeBSD `stable` (your current machine), `quarterly` (slightly newer), or `latest` (newest)

Backup the configs we're going to edit (rebooting would reset our edits to these config files so you can skip this if you'd like):

```
$ cp /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf.orig
$ cp /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf.orig
```

Disable the TrueNAS package repo:

```
$ sed -i .orig 's/enabled: yes/enabled: no/' /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf
```

#### Check FreeBSD Stable for our Package

```
$ sed -i .orig 's/enabled: no/enabled: yes/' /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
$ pkg search zrepl
```

This will output the version in stable, e.g. on TrueNAS 12.0-U7 we get:

```
$ pkg search zrepl
zrepl-0.4.0_4                  ZFS dataset replication tool
```

If that version is what you want, skip to [the installation step below](#installation). Otherwise:

#### Check FreeBSD Quarterly for our Package

```
$ sed -i .orig 's/enabled: yes/enabled: no/' /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf
$ cp /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
$ pkg update
$ pkg search zrepl
```

If that version is what you want, skip to [the installation step below](#installation). Otherwise:

#### Check FreeBSD Latest for our Package

```
$ sed -i .orig 's/enabled: yes/enabled: no/' /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf
$ cp /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
$ sed -i .quarterly 's/quarterly/latest/' /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
$ pkg update
$ pkg search zrepl
```

If that version is what you want, head to [the installation step below](#installation). Otherwise you might be fucked. 🤷🏽‍♀️

#### Installation

Now that we have repo with the `zrepl` package matching the version we want, installation is simple:

```
$ pkg install -y zrepl
```

Validate that `zrepl` is on your path:

```
$ which zrepl
/usr/local/bin/zrepl
```

And the service is available (albeit not running):

```
$ service zrepl onestatus
zrepl is not running.
```

If we were to reboot now, the service would be erased. Let's address that.

### Create a dataset

We need storage that won't be erased on reboot/upgrade. Navigate to `Storage` -> `Pools` and create a dataset called `zrepl`, e.g. `tank/zrepl` mounted at `/mnt/tank/zrepl`. You can put this somewhere else if you like, as long as it's on a storage pool. It might look like this:

```
$ zfs list
NAME                                                    USED  AVAIL     REFER  MOUNTPOINT
...
tank                                                    804M  27.8G       96K  /mnt/tank
...
tank/zrepl                                               96K  27.8G       96K  /mnt/tank/zrepl
```

### Persist the rc script

The zrepl service rc script located at `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zrepl` will get erased on reboot. To fix this, we copy it to our dataset:

```
$ cp /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zrepl /mnt/tank/zrepl/zrepl.rc.d
```

### Create your job yml

```
# Move the default job file to your storage pool
$ mv /usr/local/etc/zrepl/zrepl.yml /mnt/tank/zrepl/zrepl.yml
```

Now edit `/mnt/tank/zrepl/zrepl.yml` (e.g. with `nano`) and configure it however you'd like. See [zrepl's configuration docs](https://zrepl.github.io/configuration/overview.html) for more information.

### Create the startup script

We now need a startup script that performs the following actions on TrueNAS boot:

- Re-enable the rc service (using `sysrc`)
- Symlink our backup copy of the rc.d service script back to the `/usr/local/etc/rc.d` directory
- Symlink our job yaml file to the default location that `zrepl` looks for (`/usr/local/etc/zrepl/zrepl.yml`)
- Start the rc service

To accomplish this, use [my zrepl-start.sh script](https://alan.norbauer.com/articles/zrepl-on-truenas/scripts/zrepl-start.sh):

```
$ curl https://alan.norbauer.com/articles/zrepl-on-truenas/scripts/zrepl-start.sh -o /mnt/tank/zrepl/zrepl-start.sh
$ chmod +x /mnt/tank/zrepl/zrepl-start.sh
```

The contents of the script are straightforward:

```bash title="/mnt/tank/zrepl/zrepl-start.sh"
#!/bin/bash

SCRIPT_DIR=$( cd -- "$( dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )

# Enable the service
if [ ! -f /etc/rc.conf.d/zrepl ]
then
    touch /etc/rc.conf.d/zrepl
    sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf.d/zrepl zrepl_enable=YES
fi

# Symlink the service rc.d script
if [ ! -f /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zrepl ]
then
    ln -s ${SCRIPT_DIR}/zrepl.rc.d /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zrepl
    chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zrepl
fi

# Symlink the zrepl.yml job file
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/zrepl
if [ ! -f /usr/local/etc/zrepl/zrepl.yml ]
then
    ln -s ${SCRIPT_DIR}/zrepl.yml /usr/local/etc/zrepl/zrepl.yml
fi

# Start zrepl service
service zrepl start
```

Validate that your zrepl dataset now looks like this:

```
$ ls -1 /mnt/tank/zrepl/
zrepl-start.sh
zrepl.rc.d
zrepl.yml
```

Add `zrepl-start.sh` to TrueNAS as a Post-Init startup script:

- Go to Web GUI -> Tasks -> Init/Shutdown Scripts -> Add
  - Description = "zrepl Startup"
  - Type = "Script"
  - Select /mnt/tank/zrepl/zrepl-start.sh
  - When = "Post Init" Submit
- Go to Web GUI -> Power (top-right) -> Restart (or`reboot`in shell)
- ssh back in
- Verify zrepl is running: `service zrepl status` and `zrepl status`
- Verify your config is valid: `zrepl configcheck`

And we're done! Your TrueNAS machine should now reliably run the zrepl service and any jobs you define in `/mnt/tank/zrepl/zrepl.yml`
