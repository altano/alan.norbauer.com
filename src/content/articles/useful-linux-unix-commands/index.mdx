This will let `cd` change to a directory (exactly the same functionality as the normal `cd` command), but now you can type `bd` to go back a directory. If you keep using `bd`, it keeps going back in the history of folders you've been in.

```bash
alias cd="pushd $1 > /dev/null"
alias bd="popd > /dev/null"
```

Through subversion, move all files (NON-recursively) of type _.php from some part of the working copy to another (svn cp/mv don't seem to support _ or \*.php or any wildcards, for some reason):

```bash
find /some/path -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -iname "*.php" -exec svn mv {} /some/other/path \;
```

(Replace -exec with -ok to be prompted before each `svn mv`)

Find all files modified in the last day:

```bash
find /some/path -mtime -1
```

Find all files modified since 4pm on Sept 15 (adjust for your date/time):

```bash
touch 09151600 tmp_find_file
find /some/path -newer tmp_find_file -print
rm tmp_find_file
```

(Thanks to [linuxpowered.com](http://www.linuxpowered.com/html/editorials/find.html) for the `find` information)

Remove all subversion files from a directory

```bash
find /some/path -ipath *svn* -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

Kill all processes that match some filter text:

```bash
ps aux | grep FILTER_TEXT | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill
```
