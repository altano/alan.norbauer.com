Running ZeroTier on NixOS is dead simple (unlike [on TrueNAS](/articles/zerotier-on-truenas))

## Why

I'm going to use a [NixOS](https://nixos.org) host as the target of my zfs pool's offsite backup. The backup replication will use zrepl. [zrepl's tcp transport](https://zrepl.github.io/configuration/transports.html#tcp-transport) does not encrypt data over the wire, so we need something else that will handle that. ZeroTier is a perfect fit as it will make sure that all communication between our zrepl source and sink is encrypted. Additionally I can use ZeroTier to lock down ssh[^ssh-secure] and any other services exposed by the NixOS host.

## Prerequisites

- A default NixOS host setup with editable configs, however you do that. See [the NixOS docs](https://nixos.org/learn.html) to get started
- A ZeroTier network and the associated network id

## Setup

### Find your config values

Jot down your ZeroTier network ID from [ZeroTier Central](https://my.zerotier.com/).

Figure out what your ZeroTier network interface name will be. [As of ZeroTier v1.2.6](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md#2018-04-17----version-126), ZeroTier on Linux will use a deterministically generated interface name based on your network address, so you can get the interface name your NixOS host will from any other Linux host on your ZeroTier network:

```
$ ip -oneline -family link a | grep zt
```

The interface name will start with `zt` and have a string of characters, e.g. `zt8qqmi6zh`.

### Update your Nix config

Update your NixOS config (e.g. `configuration.nix`) with the following. I recommend putting this in `zerotier.nix` and then adding `imports = [ ./zerotier.nix ]` to your `configuration.nix`.

```nix title="zerotier.nix"
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

let
  # @TODO Fill this in
  privateZeroTierInterface = "<YOUR ZEROTIER NETWORK INTERFACE NAME>";
  # @TODO Fill this in
  zeroTierNetworkIds = [ "<YOUR ZEROTIER NETWORK ID>" ];
in
{
  # ENABLING ZEROTIER
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Non-free Licensing workaround
  nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;

  # Make the ZeroTier binaries available to all users
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.zerotierone ];

  services.zerotierone.enable = true;
  services.zerotierone.joinNetworks = zeroTierNetworkIds;
}
```

You have two options for how to poke holes in your firewall. Pick one and add it to the config above:

#### Option #1 - Open the entire ZeroTier interface and nothing else

```nix title="zerotier.nix"
  # Firewall: Open the entire ZeroTier interface
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Erect the system's firewall.
  networking.firewall.enable = true;

  # Unconditionally accept all traffic coming in from the ZeroTier interface.
  networking.firewall.trustedInterfaces = [ privateZeroTierInterface ];

  # Stop other configs from opening holes in the firewall for other interfaces,
  # as the ZeroTier interface is already trusted, e.g.:
  services.openssh.openFirewall = false;
  services.jitsi-videobridge.openFirewall = false;
  services.prometheus.exporters.node.openFirewall = false;
  ...
```

#### Option #2 - Open specific ports, only on the ZeroTier interface

```nix title="zerotier.nix"
  # Firewall: Open specific ports on the ZeroTier interface
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Erect the system's firewall.
  networking.firewall.enable = true;

  # Whenever configuring other services, only open holes in the ZeroTier
  # interface
  services.openssh.listenAddresses = [
    { addr = ????????????????; port = 22; }
  ];
  networking.firewall.interfaces.{privateZeroTierInterface}.allowedTCPPorts = [ 22 ];

  # @TODO Switch to:
  #   services.openssh.listenAddresses
  #   networking.firewall.interfaces.<name>.allowedTCPPorts
```

### Deploy the changes

- `nixos-rebuild switch`
- Authorize your new node in [ZeroTier Central](https://my.zerotier.com/)

### Verify everything looks good

- Make sure the ZeroTier service is running on the host: `systemctl status zerotierone`
- Try to connect to your new machine over ZeroTier, e.g. over ssh. I add an entry like this to my `~/.ssh/config`:
  ```text title="~/.ssh/config"
  host <alias-for-your-new-machine>
      Hostname <zerotier-ip>
      ...
  ```
  And then `ssh alias-for-your-new-machine` to make sure it works.
- From another node in your ZeroTier network you can run `zerotier-cli peers` and make sure the link is `DIRECT` to the new node

[^ssh-secure]: a bit redundant as ssh with public key authentication is already secure, but it will at least reduce spam in my logs from bots trying to log in
