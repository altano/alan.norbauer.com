TrueNAS mounts `/var` as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) that is erased on every reboot. This includes the ZeroTier database located at `/var/db/zerotier-one`. This guide demonstrates how to setup ZeroTier in a way that survives reboots and OS updates while preserving `service zerotier XXX` functionality.

## What is zerotier?

ZeroTier is:

- a mesh VPN, like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) and [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula)
- a way of securely connecting your devices over the public internet in a p2p network, without the hassle of VPN
- an emulated, secure Layer 2 ethernet network that sits on top of the public internet
- absolutely awesome software

In this case I'm installing it on TrueNAS as one piece of my "secure, offsite backup of my zfs pool" puzzle.

## Prerequisites

- TrueNAS (tested on version 12.0-U7)
  - Web GUI access
  - ssh access (with root/sudo)
- A ZeroTier network and the associated network id

## Setup

Install on TrueNAS (using FreeBSD packages):

```
sed -i .orig 's/enabled: yes/enabled: no/' /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf
sed -i .orig 's/enabled: no/enabled: yes/' /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
pkg update
pkg install -y zerotier
```

Do _not_ reboot yet.

### Setup the ZeroTier database

Start the service

```
$ service zerotier onestatus
zerotier is not running.
$ service zerotier onestart
Starting zerotier.
```

Validate the database was created

```
$ ls -1 /var/db/zerotier-one
authtoken.secret
controller.d
identity.public
identity.secret
planet
zerotier-one.pid
zerotier-one.port
```

### Move the database to a persisted zfs dataset

Navigate to `Storage` -> `Pools` and create a dataset called `zerotier`, e.g. `tank/zerotier` mounted at `/mnt/tank/zerotier`. You can put this somewhere else if you like, as long as it's on a storage pool.
Move your db to the dataset:

```
mkdir -p /mnt/tank/zerotier/db/
mv /var/db/zerotier-one/* /mnt/tank/zerotier/db/
```

Mount the dataset dir as the db where zerotier will look for it:

```
$ /sbin/mount_nullfs /mnt/tank/zerotier/db/ /var/db/zerotier-one
$ ls -1 /var/db/zerotier-one
authtoken.secret
controller.d
identity.public
identity.secret
peers.d
planet
zerotier-one.pid
zerotier-one.port
```

### Join ZeroTier network

- Join: `zerotier-cli join <NETWORK-ID>`
- Authorize the node in ZeroTier Central
- Make sure `ifconfig` shows the ZeroTier interface. Optional: `zerotier-cli info`

### Persist the rc script

The ZeroTier service rc script located at `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zerotier` will get erased on reboot, just like the `/var/db/zerotier-one/` directory. To fix this, we copy it to our dataset:

```
cp /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zerotier /mnt/tank/zerotier/zerotier.rc.d
```

### Create the startup script

We now need a startup script that performs the following actions on TrueNAS boot:

- Re-mount the ZeroTier DB in our dataset to the /var/db/zerotier-one directory.
- Symlink our backup copy of the rc.d service script back to the `/usr/local/etc/rc.d` directory
- Re-enable the rc service (using `sysrc`)
- Start the rc service

To accomplish this, use [my zerotier-start.sh script](https://alan.norbauer.com/articles/zerotier-on-truenas/scripts/zerotier-start.sh):

```
curl https://alan.norbauer.com/articles/zerotier-on-truenas/scripts/zerotier-start.sh -o /mnt/tank/zerotier/zerotier-start.sh
chmod +x /mnt/tank/zerotier/zerotier-start.sh
```

The contents of the script are straightforward:

```bash title="/mnt/tank/zerotier/zerotier-start.sh"
#!/bin/bash

SCRIPT_DIR=$( cd -- "$( dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )
DB_DIR=${SCRIPT_DIR}/db

# If you are running other daemons or require firewall rules to depend on
# zerotier interfaces being available at startup, you may need to uncomment
# the following line.
#
# This avoids a race condition where zerotier interfaces are created, but
# not up, prior to firewalls and services trying to use them.
#
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1

# Remove the zerotier_enable rc.conf entry if you already
# have it. This will be set by our start script, as zerotier
# might start before the mountpoint is available, making
# zerotier create new keys at each boot. This is prevented by
# only enabling the service after the mountpoint is available.
if [ ! -f /etc/rc.conf.d/zerotier ]
then
    touch /etc/rc.conf.d/zerotier
    sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf.d/zerotier zerotier_enable=YES
fi

if [ ! -f /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zerotier ]
then
    ln -s ${SCRIPT_DIR}/zerotier.rc.d /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zerotier
    chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zerotier
fi

# Stop zerotier so we can modify the db directory location
service zerotier stop

# Use the zfs pool to store the db (to survive reboots)
mkdir -p ${DB_DIR}
mkdir -p /var/db/zerotier-one
/sbin/mount_nullfs ${DB_DIR} /var/db/zerotier-one

# Start zerotier service
service zerotier start
```

Validate that your zerotier dataset now looks like this:

```
$ ls -1 /mnt/tank/zerotier
db
zerotier-start.sh
zerotier.rc.d
```

Add `zerotier-start.sh` to TrueNAS as a Pre-Init startup script:

- Go to Web GUI -> Tasks -> Init/Shutdown Scripts -> Add
  - Description = "ZeroTier Startup"
  - Type = "Script"
  - Select /mnt/tank/zerotier/zerotier-start.sh
  - When = "Pre Init" Submit
- Go to Web GUI -> Power (top-right) -> Restart (or`reboot`in shell)
- ssh back in
- Verify zerotier is running: `zerotier-cli info` and `ifconfig`

And we're done! Your TrueNAS machine should now reliably remain on your ZeroTier network.
